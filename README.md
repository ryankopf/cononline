# CON ONLINE

Due to COVID-19, many anime conventions have been forced to cancel.

[CON ONLINE](https://cononline.app) is an open source platform for conventions to take place.

Highlights

* Free and open source

* Support community exhibitors

* Buy directly from artists and vendors

* Share cosplays and photos

* Be online with other attendees

* No advertising or profits made by the Con Online hosts

If you don't like our CON ONLINE, you are free to host your own! Installation instructions can be found below.

# Contributing

See [how to contribute](https://jarv.is/notes/how-to-pull-request-fork-github/) to a Git project. You can also make smaller automated pull requests using the Github website and clicking "edit", which will allow you to fork our project and submit a pull request when you're done.

Never contributed to an open source project before? That's okay!

Forking means to copy the project and make your own clone. You will make your edits and suggested changes there, and then you submit a "pull request", requesting that we accept your changes. Any changes you submit you agree to license under the same license as the rest of the project.

# Future development

* Make sure carts transfer from not-logged-in to the logged-in user when you login after adding products first.
* On the dealers and artists page, show a list of all the presently logged-on attendees/cosplayers "browsing now"
* Enable chatting between attendees/cosplayers using ActionCable
* More testing of the products, carts, and orders features.
